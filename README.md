# DS_Project
In this project we introduce a solution for sampling visual image and IMU data with precise timestamp, where the data is sent from the system wirelessly to a ground station (PC)  with delay restrictions.

The system is to be installed on a drone and its purpose is to run SLAM algorithm on a ground station.
